          Working at Interlay was a fun experience especially with an incredibly
          talented team. My previous development experience was limited to
          3devs, Interlay has helped me write code professionally with lots of
          devs working on the same project. I’ve learned to use git in a
          professional dev environment, pushing PRs with proper commits,
          comments and following product release cycles which makes the job of
          reviewers easy. I’ve learned to use fun tools like VIM and shell
          commands which I have to admit have a steep learning curve yet VIM
          became my favourite editor. Interlay being a remote team, asynchronous
          communication and communicating explicitly is another thing that I
          grasped.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the building part, I’ve learned to use React hooks, TypeScript,
          nitty-gritty of JavaScript and a bit of Rust. While designing for
          interBTC, I’ve put a lot of research into understanding UX issues that
          new users might face when they enter the crypto space and trying to
          resolve them by putting forth easy-to-use and straightforward designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, working at Interlay grew me as both a developer and a
          designer. I learnt to take responsibility for my work, experimenting,
          picking new skills in no time and most importantly gave me a warm
          feeling that the work I do matters.
