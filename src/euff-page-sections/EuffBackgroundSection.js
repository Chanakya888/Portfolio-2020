Being a new intern, wishbox studio entrusted me with the EU delegation of India, I was excited to work with them as this festival has been long-running internationally for around 23years, this was the first time they were organizing it in India. </p> 
                <p>The goal of this project was to create an intuitive way for a visitor to know more about the film heâ€™s interested in and display a well designed schedule which has films at multiple locations in the city for different films, all of this while allowing the organisers to quickly edit the information provided on the website.
