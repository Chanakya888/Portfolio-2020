				<p>
					Linus from Linus Tech Tips is the one who got me interested in tech in my school days. I enjoy messing around with custom ROMs and tinkering with Operating Systems. I always seemed to create and ideate upon things that solve problems. This interest drove me to pursue computer
					science engineering at BML Munjal University.{' '}
				</p>
				<p>
					I started by designing posters and promotional material for college events using photoshop and illustrator, I picked up video editing with FCPX, creating promotional content, which landed an opportunity to edit videos for TEDxBMU, which I did for two events. Later, I became the
					president of club Sierra which focuses on social entrepreneurship and licensed events, we organised TEDxBMU 2019, and started a MUN society at BMU by organising an interMUN and smaller IntraMUNs.{' '}
				</p>
				<p>Both my summer internships in 2019 and 2020 were with Wishbox studio for a total of 10months where I worked as a UI/UX designer and a web developer. I worked with clients such as the European Union of India, Just Jobs Network, and Capital Square Partners. </p>
