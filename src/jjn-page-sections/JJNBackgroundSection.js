								JustJobs Network is a private, nonpartisan organization finding evidence-based solutions to one of the most pressing challenges of our time: How to create more and better jobs worldwide. JustJobs convenes a global network of diverse stakeholders—including policy
								shapers, academics, and grassroots leaders — to deepen the practical implications of our research endeavors and amplify their impact.
							</p><p>Just Jobs Network was looking for a rebranding and a redesign of its website. The earlier website was built on WordPress CMS, JJN felt that the design of the earlier one was not in terms with the modern design,  categorisation of the tagging system was not compatible with their research posts anymore, and the CMS that they were using was frustrating to use for the editors, the biggest challenge the editors were facing while posting content on CMS was the improper functionality of tags that are important to a research-based website. </p> <p>While designing the new website, our main challenge was to build a functional categorisation system for enormous amounts of data that is easy to use for users and editors alike. We also had to make sure that the design of the categorisation system will be working well into the future.</p>"
