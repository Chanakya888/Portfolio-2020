developer in the summer of 2020. This time, I got an opportunity to 
work with Capital Square Partners, they previously had a website that 
was built using square space website builder. The team at CSP wasnâ€™t 
satisfied with the outcome from square space builder, they contacted 
wishbox studio for a complete redesign of the website which 
showcases CSP as not another investment company but as a brand of 
investment.</p><p>The goal of the project is to redesign and develop the website of CSP 
showcasing CSP as an investment brand. The client desired a CMS 
which allows them to edit any content on the website, including 
updating or deleting team members and investments. </p>"
